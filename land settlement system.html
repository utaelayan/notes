         <p style="max-width: 600px;">The land settlement system is a process that establishes, documents, and regulates land ownership and land-use rights within a specific geographic area. It includes land tenure systems, which define the rights and obligations of individuals or groups over land. It also includes land surveying and mapping, which are necessary for determining land parcels, delineating land boundaries, and recording land ownership details.</p>
